(Here's what you'll have by the end of the process)

- I needed to do some configuration to get things working properly, but I am happy I persisted with it because it's a great tool.

- Installing PostgreSQL 15, MinIO, Chrome (browserless) & Redis containers were pretty quick to do, once you know the right settings of course.
