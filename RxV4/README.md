# Reactive Resume V4 on an Unraid server via the CA installation

- Installing this container requires the installation of 4 other supporting containers.
- **You've been warned 😄 this isn't a standalone container when run in Unraid CA**.

- I needed to do some configuration to get things working properly, but I am happy I persisted with it because I think it's great.
- Installing PostgreSQL 15, MinIO, Chrome (browserless) & Redis containers were pretty quick to do, once you know the right settings of course.
- The support thread for this container is located in the Unraid Forums [here](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/152057-support-eurotimmy-reactive-resume-v4-rxv4/), please post any questions or contributions.
